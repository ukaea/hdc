Things to do:
- unit tests for plugin storage seletion and settings
- unit test for serialization
- rewrite unit tests to test all storage plugins
- proper ordering of init
- clean up:
  - in c++:
    - functions => static methods
    - use namespaces
  - in API's:
    - Fortran object???
    - generate all types from templates
- HDF5 list support
- faster JSON (zero copy)
- dynamic buffer headers
- buffer header versioning (or just add data offset st the beginning)
- revise handling of multidim arrays in C / Fortran
    - storage will be allways contiguous in memory =>
        - provide indexing macro for C
        - fortran seems to be able to build array of any shape around the buffer
- boost::variant instead of char* buffer?
